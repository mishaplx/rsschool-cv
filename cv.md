 ## About me
I have experience in programming Python, PHP, jQuery, JavaScript, as well as working with MySql databases and working in graphic packages such as Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. I have developed various user interfaces such as multi-page sites, landing pages. I also have experience in back-end development - writing php scripts and working with databases. I’m always investigating new areas of programming. Gain additional knowledge of new technologies, approaches, and apply them in practice. Never stop learning. I’m a real team player and also can work individually. I'm attentive to details. I don’t afraid of non-standard situations, overtimes. I'm very responsible about quality of my work, always meet deadlines. My main goal is to grow as a Front-end developer.
